# 5eJSON2TEX
A python tool converting 5e.tools compatible JSON files to Latex (and ultimately PDF) form.
It's nowhere near done, but it's a rudimentary skelleton of what might one day be.
## Notes
In order to convert the generated Latex file to pdf, you'll need to have both
- pdflatex and,
- the DND 5E Latex Template (https://github.com/rpgtex/DND-5e-LaTeX-Template)
